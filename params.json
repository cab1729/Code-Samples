The code is purposely trivial to focus on the technical capabilities of \r\nJEE 6 to  produce  a Spring/Hibernate type application.  The component projects are as follows:\r\n\r\n- EJB 3.0 session bean with client. The session bean exposes its access method as a SOAP web service. \r\n- Web application with servlet, RESTful service  and JSF 2.0 interfaces. REST service returns info as XML (using JAXB), \r\n  JSON and plain text.\r\n- JPA Entity bean (database: Oracle 11g)\r\n\r\n(For additional code samples, see [Gists:] https://gist.github.com/cab1729)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
